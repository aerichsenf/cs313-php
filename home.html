        <h1>This is me:</h1>
        <p>I'm from Porto Alegre Brazil. I got called to serve in the Illinois Peoria Mission.
        I got the opportunity to know Nauvoo and a lot of church history. I've been married for
        6 years now and my wife and I have a beautiful daughter. I'm a SE major and I'm
        excited to have my internship next semester and finally put in practice everything I'm
        learning in school. For fun, I like to play games, play the drums and travel.</p>

<h1>Facts about me</h1>
<div class="flex-container">

    <div class="flex-item">
        <h2>Fact 1</h2>
        <h3>Before coming to the USA. We had an English Language School
        in Brazil. Most of our students were engineers and that's how I fell in love
        with technology.</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="flex-item">
        <h2>Fact 2</h2>
        <h3>After a few years doing good in our business and working
    really hard, we felt prompt by the Spirit to sell the school and continue
            our education. That was the hardest decision we ever made, but that
            gave us the chance to come to the US and invest in our future.</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="flex-item">
        <h2>Fact 3</h2>
        <h3>We came to Salt Lake City where I graduated with an A.S. in
        Business from the LDS Business College and decided to pursue a B.S. in Software
        Engineering.</h3>
